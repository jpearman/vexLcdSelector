This code was first posted as part of this discussion thread on vexforum.  
[robotc-lcd-autonomous-selection](http://www.vexforum.com/index.php/10510-robotc-lcd-autonomous-selection/0)  
  
It's been revised for RobotC V4.54 to remove warnings and update some of the old V3.XX API calls that have changed.

Also a couple of small bug fixes affecting Demo 4 have been fixed.
